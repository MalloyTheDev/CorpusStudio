"""The supervised training WORKER — the child process of the subprocess run supervisor.

Reads a ``run_dispatch`` :class:`WorkerMessage` (the immutable RunPlan, by value) from stdin, runs it
through the in-process supervisor + the chosen :class:`Runner`, and streams the result back as
WorkerMessages (JSON-lines) on **stdout**: ``run_accepted`` (with the pid) → ``event`` per RunEvent →
``terminal_result`` (the RunManifest + a FailureTaxonomy outcome). stdout is the protocol channel (one
JSON WorkerMessage per line, flushed); **stderr is free** for telemetry.

Running in its own process is the whole point: it lets the PARENT time out and KILL a hung run — the
thing the in-process watchdog can only *detect* — and isolates a backend crash (a segfault, a CUDA
abort) from the core. Dependency-light at import (the heavy stack is lazy-imported by the runner it
dispatches to, never here).
