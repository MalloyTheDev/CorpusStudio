"""Real runners that plug into the platform run supervisor — platform slice 4.

The :class:`~corpus_studio.platform.supervisor.EchoRunner` proves the harness with zero heavy deps;
this module adds the runner that executes an ACTUAL training run. :class:`TrainingRunner` dispatches
by the RunPlan's chosen backend (``backend_ref`` — ``corpus_studio`` → ``trainer.run_training``,
``unsloth`` → ``unsloth_trainer.run_unsloth_training``; ``cpu_toy`` always uses the first-party CPU
smoke path): it reads the trainer config from the RunPlan's ``training_config_snapshot``, adapts the
``(step, total, loss)`` progress into ``RunEvent`` metrics, cooperatively aborts on cancel, classifies
a missing runtime as an ``ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE`` (never a crash), and returns the produced adapter
artifact. Both backends share the ``(config, *, progress_callback) -> TrainResult`` shape, so the
progress/cancel/error-classification harness is identical — "pick your framework", one runner.

The heavy stack (torch/transformers/…) is lazy-imported **inside** ``run()`` — importing this module
pulls only the platform contracts + the (import-light) trainer module, so the dependency-light
boundary holds. ``cpu_toy=True`` runs the tiny CPU smoke path (needs the ``[train]`` extra but no
GPU); the real GPU QLoRA path can only be user-smoke-tested.
